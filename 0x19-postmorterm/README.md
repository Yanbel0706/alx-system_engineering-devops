The Great E-commerce Traffic Jam of 2022

Duration of Outage:

End: June 25, 2022, 12:30 PM UTC

Impact:
Our primary e-commerce service experienced a traffic jam of epic proportions. Picture rush hour traffic in a single lane instead of a multi-lane highway. Users were stuck, some couldn't even get on the highway, and about 60% of users experienced slow loading times on product pages. The other 40% were just banging their heads against a “Server Error” wall.

Root Cause:
The root cause was a classic "Oops, did I do that?" moment—a misconfiguration in the load balancer that sent all traffic to a single server, making it sweat more than a turkey on Thanksgiving.

Timeline
10:00 AM: Issue detected by an automated monitoring alert screaming, “Something's broken!”
10:05 AM: On-call engineer, feeling like Sherlock Holmes, discovered one server drowning in requests.
10:15 AM: Escalated to the Network Operations Team to check if we were under attack by aliens (or a DDoS attack).
10:30 AM: Misleading path taken, suspecting a DDoS attack because the traffic pattern was more chaotic than a kindergarten class on a sugar high.
11:00 AM: Load balancer logs revealed that traffic was playing favorites with one server.
11:15 AM: Load Balancer Configuration Team summoned, like the Avengers, to fix the configuration mess.
11:45 AM: Configuration error identified—cue facepalm—and corrected.
12:00 PM: Traffic normalized, and users were back to shopping happily.
12:30 PM: Issue officially resolved, and servers were given a much-needed break.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
Our load balancer had a moment of “Oops, my bad!” due to a typo in the routing rules. This tiny typo caused all the traffic to dogpile onto one server, which then had a meltdown.

Resolution:
We fixed the typo faster than you can say "load balancer." The corrected configuration was deployed, restoring order and spreading traffic evenly across all servers. Monitoring continued to ensure no further shenanigans.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:

Enhanced Deployment Validation: We'll catch typos and misconfigurations like a grammar nazi on a mission.
Improved Monitoring: Set up to detect load balancing issues before they snowball into chaos.
Regular Audits: We'll regularly check load balancer configurations like we check our Instagram—frequently.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Patch Nginx Server: Ensure the load balancer software (Nginx) is updated to the latest version, with fewer bugs than a summer camp.
Add Monitoring on Server Memory: Implement monitoring on server memory usage to spot overloads faster than a caffeine-fueled engineer.
Automate Configuration Testing: Develop automated tests for load balancer configurations to catch errors before they reach production.
Train Staff on Best Practices: Conduct training sessions for engineers on load balancer configuration best practices, avoiding future "Oops" moments.
Review and Update Documentation: Update deployment and configuration documentation with steps that are as clear as a sunny day.
By addressing these areas, we'll prevent similar incidents in the future and keep our e-commerce platform running smoother than a jazz saxophone solo.
